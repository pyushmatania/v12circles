## 🔧 Pre-Deployment Tasks

### 1. Environment Variables
- [ ] Ensure all API keys are properly set in production environment
- [ ] Check TMDB API key configuration
- [ ] Verify Spotify API integration
- [ ] Test Sentry error reporting

### 2. Build Testing
```bash
# Test production build
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Check bundle size
# Open dist/stats.html to analyze bundle
```

### 3. Performance Testing
- [ ] Test image loading performance
- [ ] Verify lazy loading works correctly
- [ ] Check bundle size is reasonable (< 2MB total)
- [ ] Test on mobile devices

### 4. Cross-Browser Testing
- [ ] Chrome/Chromium
- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Safari
- [ ] Edge
- [ ] Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

### 5. Functionality Testing
- [ ] User authentication flow
- [ ] Image loading in all components
- [ ] Navigation between pages
- [ ] Search functionality
- [ ] Community features
- [ ] Project details
- [ ] Admin panel (if applicable)

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

### 2. Test Build Locally
```bash
npm run preview
```

### 3. Deploy to Hosting Platform
- [ ] Upload `dist/` folder contents
- [ ] Configure server to serve `index.html` for all routes (SPA routing)
- [ ] Set up proper caching headers for static assets

### 4. Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Test all image loading
- [ ] Verify no console errors
- [ ] Check performance metrics
- [ ] Test on different devices/browsers

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Image Loading Issues
**Problem**: Images not loading after deployment
**Solution**: ✅ Fixed - All images now use proper Vite imports

### Console Errors
**Problem**: Browser console errors in production
**Solution**: ✅ Fixed - Added SSR-safe utilities and error boundaries

### Performance Issues
**Problem**: Slow loading times
**Solution**: ✅ Fixed - Added compression, chunk splitting, and lazy loading

### Routing Issues
**Problem**: 404 errors on direct page access
**Solution**: Configure server to serve `index.html` for all routes

## 📊 Performance Targets
- [ ] First Contentful Paint: < 1.5s
- [ ] Largest Contentful Paint: < 2.5s
- [ ] Total Bundle Size: < 2MB
- [ ] Image Loading: < 1s per image

## 🔍 Monitoring
- [ ] Set up Sentry error monitoring
- [ ] Configure performance monitoring
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring
- [ ] Monitor user analytics

## 📝 Notes
- All image paths have been converted to use Vite's asset handling
- SSR-safe utilities prevent hydration mismatches
- Production error boundary provides better user experience
- Bundle optimization reduces loading times
- Compression reduces bandwidth usage

## ✅ Ready for Deployment
All critical issues have been resolved. The application should now deploy successfully with proper image loading and optimal performance.
