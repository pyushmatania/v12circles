# Mobile Video Autoplay Fix

## Problem
Videos were not autoplaying on mobile devices (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile, etc.) in the project details page.

## Root Cause
Mobile browsers have strict autoplay policies that require videos to be muted for autoplay to work. The original implementation had:
- `muted={false}` which prevents autoplay on mobile
- No mobile detection to handle different requirements
- Missing mobile-specific attributes and fallbacks

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Mobile Detection
- Imported and used `useIsMobile` hook to detect mobile devices
- Applied mobile-specific video settings based on device type

### 2. Updated Video Element Attributes
```jsx
<video
  ref={videoRef}
  className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full object-cover"
  onLoadedData={handleVideoLoad}
  muted={isMobile ? true : false}  // Muted on mobile, unmuted on desktop
  loop
  playsInline
  autoPlay
  preload="auto"
  webkit-playsinline="true"  // iOS Safari compatibility
>
```

### 3. Enhanced Auto-play Logic
- Mobile videos start muted to comply with autoplay policies
- Desktop videos can start unmuted
- Added fallback logic: if autoplay fails, retry with muted video
- Proper error handling with console logging

### 4. Updated YouTube Embed URLs
- Dynamic mute parameter based on device: `&mute=${isMobile ? 1 : 0}`
- Ensures YouTube videos also respect mobile autoplay requirements

### 5. Added User Interaction Handling
- Mobile users can tap the video to unmute after autoplay starts
- YouTube videos can be unmuted on user interaction
- Graceful fallback if unmuting fails

### 6. Mobile UX Enhancement
- Added "Tap to unmute" indicator for mobile users
- Appears when video is playing but muted on mobile
- Clear visual feedback for user interaction

## Technical Details

### Mobile Autoplay Requirements
According to mobile browser policies:
- **iOS Safari**: Requires `muted`, `playsInline`, and `autoplay` attributes
- **Chrome Mobile**: Requires `muted` attribute for autoplay
- **User interaction**: Can override mute requirements after initial autoplay

### Implementation Benefits
1. **Cross-platform compatibility**: Works on both mobile and desktop
2. **Progressive enhancement**: Starts muted on mobile, allows unmuting on interaction
3. **Better UX**: Clear indicators and smooth transitions
4. **Compliance**: Follows mobile browser autoplay policies

### Files Modified
- `src/components/ProjectDetailPage.tsx`: Main video component logic
- Added mobile detection and conditional rendering
- Enhanced error handling and user interaction

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test on iOS Safari (iPhone/iPad)
2. Test on Chrome Mobile (Android)
3. Test on desktop browsers (should work as before)
4. Verify tap-to-unmute functionality on mobile
5. Check YouTube video autoplay on both mobile and desktop

## Browser Support
- ✅ iOS Safari 10+ (with `playsinline` and `muted`)
- ✅ Chrome Mobile 54+ (with `muted`)
- ✅ Firefox Mobile 49+
- ✅ Desktop browsers (all modern browsers)
- ⚠️ Some older mobile browsers may still require user interaction

The fix ensures videos autoplay reliably across all platforms while providing a good user experience with the ability to unmute on mobile devices through user interaction.
